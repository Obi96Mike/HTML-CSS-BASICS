Content is the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other media.

WIDTH AND HEIGHT properties change the size of the content box of block ele. Inline elements require the display property.

PADDING is used to create extra space within an element, between content and border; adds/ removes space inside of the element but around content box.
(adding some space outside content area). All values must be a positive number.

Margin is space outside of the border used to create extra space around an element; 
margin is used to space elements.
(adding/ creating some space in between different elements and to keep them from overlapping).
Most browsers use 16px for top and bottom margins; 
A value of auto can also be used to allow the browser to choose margins, which will usually center block elements horizontally.
Adjacent horizontal margins will be added together to determine the space between elements. 
Vertical margins wull be collapsed, meaning only the larger margin value will be used.
Negative margins used to shift things slightly.
