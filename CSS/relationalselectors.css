/* COMBINATOR / RELATIONAL SELECTORS - combines multiple selectors to select elements based on their location in the DOM; selects elements based on their relationship with other elements.

Advantages
Cleaner markup because we dont have to assign IDs and classes to various HTML elements

Disadvantages
Can be fragile because they are depenedent on the location of thes elements in the DOM. If you move elements around, our styles will break.
Not as performant/ fast as basic selectors.
