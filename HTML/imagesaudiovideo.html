    <!--img tag is an empty tag with 2 primary attributes
      src: The path to the image, either relative or absolute
      alt: Alternative text to be used with screen readers for visually impaired people or any time the image cannot be displayed.
      Height, width : this let the browser know how much space the image needs before the file is fetched, improving performance.
      srcset: allows you to specify multiple files to be used based on either viewport width or image pixel width; it lets the browser choose from options that fit the specific situation, minimizing bandwidth consumption while producing attrative results. The w specification instead of the x is used to consider both the display density and window width when choosing image source.
      sizes: lists which size image to use at which media query.
    To change from a resolution -based srcset to a width-based srcset, provide pixel measurements (w) instead of 1x, 2x.-->
