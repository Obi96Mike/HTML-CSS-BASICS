<!--HTML attributes that provide accessible information about a specific element. Used any time the existing markup makes things confusing in the accessibility tree.
    Another kind of attribute that can be added to any HTML element to give it more meaning and to make sure the browser understands what something is.
    Ideally, we won't need an ARIA Role. If we use a proper HTML element we'll communicate the right message about the semantics of the content. But sometimes things are not ideal.
