<!--The algorithm used by the browser to determine which CSS declarations to use when an element is selected by two rulesets with the same property
    Specificity is roughly calculated by counting the number of each selector type involved in a selector and multiplying by weights.
    These weights are as follows:
    Inline styles: 1000
    ID: 100
    Classes: 10
    Pseudo-classes: 10
    Attributes: 10
    Elements: 1
    Pseudo-elements: 1

    If multiple rules target the same element, the browser will apply the rule that is more specific.
    Each selector has a specificity/ weight.

    Specificity triangle
    ID selector; #products; We cannot have two elements with the same ID, so the ID selector is very specific. It can only target a specific element
    Class & attribute selectors; .product; Less specific because we can have multiple elements with the same class or attributes
    Element selectors; section; because we can have many elements of a given type.
