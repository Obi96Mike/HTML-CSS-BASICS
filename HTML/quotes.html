    <h2>Beekeeping</h2>
    <p>
      Humans have kept honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, for millenia.
      Beekepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from
      hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees for sale
      to other beekeepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years
      ago; efforts to domesticate them are shown in Egyptian art around 4,500
      years ago.
      <sup>[91]</sup>
      Simple hives and smoke were used; jars of honey were found in the tombs of
      pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. From the 18th century, European
      understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction
      of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested wothout
      destroying the colony.

    <h3>Bee An Apple</h3>

The taste of an apple,
      the cringing of a beer

    <h2>Thoughts on bees</h2>
    <blockquote contenteditable="false">
      I've said this over and over, but I'll say it a million more times - I'm
      concerned more about the death of a bee than I am about terrorism. Because
      we're losing hives and bees by the millions because of such strong
      pesticides.
